Collected demographic data by monitoring water sources, collecting fecal pellets, hiking transects, and using the double observer method from a helicopter.  Monitored bighorn survival with radio telemetry while flying for multiple hours in a Cessna 185.  Performed field necropsies to collect biological and disease samples and determine cause of mortality.  Inspected and monitored natural and artificial water sources and coordinated efforts for maintenance, repair, and water hauling with other government agencies and NGOs.  Assisted in the organization and execution of capture activities including leading processing crews in restraining and collaring the animal and collecting multiple biological samples including blood and physical measurements, all while continually monitoring vitals.  Educated the public about desert and Sierra Nevada bighorn including at the Sheep Show and with a delegation from Kazakhstan.  Assisted in the organization of and presented at desert bighorn hunter orientations and conducted hunter harvest check-outs.  Operated 4x4 vehicles on rough terrain and deep sand for long hours at a time.  Manipulated and analyzed data using ArcGIS, Program R, and Microsoft Access.  Coauthored and created professional maps for official Department reports. Organized and managed large datasets.

	\cventry{Adirondack Raptors}{Raptor Banding Field Technician}{Adirondack Mountains, NY}{2014 - 2016}{\begin{cvitems}
\item Deployed and monitored mistnets and removed, banded, and took physical measurements of Northern saw-whet owls (Aegolius acadicus) from sunset until early morning.  Trapped, measured, and banded red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) using bal chatri traps.  Identified perched and flying raptor species of northern New York.  Conducted Northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) nest searches in old-growth coniferous forest.  Handled numerous captive hawk and owl species during educational presentations.
