Alembic is a starting point for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) projects. Rather than starting from scratch, this boilerplate is designed to get rolling immediately. Install it, configure it, tweak it, push it.


## Examples

Hello! My name is Ashley Evans.  I received Bachelor of Science degrees in both Fish and Wildlife Science and Natural Resource Sustainability Studies from Paul Smith’s College in 2016.  Throughout the course of my studies, I gained field experience in the classroom and through technician positions on various projects.  I conducted experimental trials to examine behavioral thermoregulation of spiny mountain lizards in New Mexico, collected genetic samples from black bears in Louisiana, raised orphaned mantled howler monkeys in Panama, and banded raptors in the Adirondack Mountains.  My senior capstone project was a management plan for the reintroduction of wolverine into Colorado.  I also left plenty of time for fun as I competed on the cross country, snowshoe racing, Nordic skiing, and marathon canoe racing teams at Paul Smith’s.

After graduating summa cum laude, I moved to Bishop, California where I worked on the desert bighorn management program for California Department of Fish and Wildlife.  This is where I first experienced the complexity of state-level wildlife management and came to appreciate the collaboration, knowledge, and research required to make informed and effective management decisions.  I was involved in some really cool monitoring and management actions including flying helicopter surveys over desert ranges, monitoring water sources in sweltering summer temperatures, assisting with mule deer and desert bighorn captures, and checking out hunter-harvested rams.  I was exposed to the extreme temperatures and unforgiving but spectacular landscapes of the Mojave Desert where I was in awe of the adaptations that make life possible in such a harsh environment.  I gained invaluable experience during my time with CDFW and also made lifelong friends and lasting memories, but after four years, I wanted to be more involved in the research, management, and decision making of wildlife biology.  For me, the logical next step was graduate school.

I was accepted into Dr. James Cain’s lab at New Mexico State University in Fall 2020.  I was taken on as the sole graduate student for a rigorous research project into the influence of human recreation on desert bighorn in the Dominguez-Escalante National Conservation area, located in western Colorado.  The objectives of my thesis research are to determine how recreation influences desert bighorn behavior, stress hormones, movements, and habitat selection.  I have spent thousands of hours behind my spotting scope over the last two years, observing desert bighorn behavior in dramatic and beautiful canyon landscapes and loving [nearly] every minute of it.  Now that my data collection has concluded, I am now focused on analyzing the staggering amounts of data that my technicians and I have collected.  I am excited that my close collaboration with Bureau of Land Management and Colorado Parks and Wildlife means that the results of my thesis will be used to inform management of the land, wildlife, and people of not only my study area, but also landscapes beyond my reach.  And that is the goal of my career; to contribute to the informed management of our invaluable wildlife populations, the complex ecosystems that support them, and the people who need to coexist with it all.


## Installation


1. [Fork the repo](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic#fork-destination-box)
2. Replace the `Gemfile` with one stating all the gems used in your project
3. Delete the following unnecessary files/folders: `.github`, `LICENSE`, `screenshot.png`, `CNAME` and `alembic-jekyll-theme.gemspec`
4. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy
5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
6. Done! Use the [configuration](#configuration) documentation and the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons

## Customising

When using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.

To add your own styles copy the [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/assets/styles.scss) into your own project with the same file path (`assets/styles.scss`). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the `@import "alembic";` line.

If you're looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the [`_settings.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_settings.scss) file in your own `styles.scss`, make sure to state them before the `@import "alembic";` line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.
